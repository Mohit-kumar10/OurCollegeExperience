    experiences are the best experiences in one's life,
  we too have the same expectations.<br> 
  But initially when our classes started in online mode we were not meeting with these expectations,<br> 
  We were getting bored in home. But anyhow we managed to enjoy by regular chit-chats with batch mates<br>
   and through whatsapp groups.We were always waiting for official notice of college reopening<br> to come.
  Soon after the end of 1<sup>st</sup>semester we got the official notice for college reopening, our excitement<br>
   reached upto another level. Finally we came to our campus and happy to see our hostels and classroom 
   infrastructure.<br>In hostel, life is really very different celebrating birthday of friends in midnight, 
   giving them a good memorable treat<br> is an example of enjoying hostel life.Our academic classes are also going good 
  professors are really dedicated and <br>
  very good. In weekends we are visiting few tourist attraction places of 
  Ranchi-the Capital city of Jharkhand. And finally<br> we can say that
   we are meeting our expectations and yet more to 
  come </p></div>
